# Poll status of a Bright Discovery

This action polls a Bright discovery until it finishes, or its time runs out.

### Build Secure Apps & APIs. Fast.

[Bright](https://www.brightsec.com) is a powerful dynamic application & API security testing (DAST) platform that security teams trust and developers love.

### Automatically Tests Every Aspect of Your Apps & APIs

Scans any target, whether Web Apps, APIs (REST. & SOAP, GraphQL & more), Web sockets or mobile, providing actionable reports

### Seamlessly integrates with the Tools and Workflows You Already Use

Bright works with your existing CI/CD pipelines ‚Äì trigger scans on every commit, pull request or build with unit testing.

### Spin-Up, Configure and Control Scans with Code

One file. One command. One scan. No UI needed.

### Super-Fast Scans

Interacts with applications and APIs, instead of just crawling them and guessing.
Scans are fast as our AI-powered engine can understand application architecture and generate sophisticated and targeted attacks.

### No False Positives

Stop chasing ghosts and wasting time. Bright doesn‚Äôt return false positives, so you can focus on releasing code.

### Comprehensive Security Testing

Bright tests for all common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, CSRF, XSS, and XXE -- as well as uncommon vulnerabilities, such as business logic vulnerabilities.
